# migration-run Specification (delta)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Driver preflight before touching the database

`run_migration.sh` SHALL run the host-scope preflight (chain tools, PostgreSQL, dump integrity) before
restoring anything, and the database-scope preflight (source-version match from `ir_module_module`,
installed modules, per-step addons coverage) immediately after the initial restore and before step 1. Any
failed check SHALL abort the driver with a non-zero exit and a message naming the failed check; coverage
findings SHALL name the directory the operator must fill.

#### Scenario: Host failure aborts before restore

- **WHEN** the driver starts on a chain that needs Docker and the daemon is not responding
- **THEN** it exits non-zero naming the Docker check, without creating or restoring the working database

#### Scenario: Version mismatch aborts after restore, before step 1

- **WHEN** the restored database's `base` version does not match the environment's declared source
- **THEN** the driver exits non-zero naming the mismatch and runs no migration step
