# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Read-only host readiness report

The system SHALL provide a `provision check` that inspects the host and renders a capability table of
(capability, state, detail) where state is one of OK / MISSING / WARN / INFO, covering the host OS release,
the Odoo build dependencies, PostgreSQL (presence, service, development role, and server version against the
matrix floor), wkhtmltopdf, Node + rtlcss, the system Python, `uv` (migration and out-of-range workspace
interpreters), and Docker (migration 12/13 fallback). `check` MUST NOT modify the host in any way.

#### Scenario: Report on a host missing prerequisites

- **WHEN** `provision check` runs on a host without PostgreSQL and without the build dependencies
- **THEN** it prints a table marking those capabilities MISSING and makes no changes to the host

#### Scenario: Report on a ready host

- **WHEN** every prerequisite is already present
- **THEN** every capability is reported OK and nothing is installed

### Requirement: PostgreSQL readiness detection

The system SHALL detect whether PostgreSQL is installed, whether its service is running, whether a usable
development role exists, and which server version is installed, reporting each as a distinct signal in the
table. The installed server version SHALL be compared against the minimum PostgreSQL the support matrix
declares for the Odoo versions in play, and reported WARN when it is below that floor, naming both versions.

#### Scenario: PostgreSQL installed but no dev role

- **WHEN** PostgreSQL is running but the expected development role does not exist
- **THEN** the report marks PostgreSQL OK (running) and the dev role MISSING

#### Scenario: Server version below the matrix floor is flagged

- **WHEN** the installed PostgreSQL server is older than the floor the matrix declares for a version in play
- **THEN** the row is WARN and names the installed version, the required floor and the Odoo version requiring
  it

#### Scenario: Server version at or above the floor is OK

- **WHEN** the installed PostgreSQL server meets the floor for every version in play
- **THEN** the version row is OK and states the detected server version

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Package-family detection

**Reason**: The tool now declares a supported-host list (Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04) in the support matrix rather
than a package family. Reporting "the apt family" implied support for Debian hosts that were never validated,
so family detection is replaced by supported-release detection.

**Migration**: Replaced by "Supported host release detection" below. A Debian or other apt-family host that
was previously reported as supported is now reported as unsupported; `provision check` still completes and
still changes nothing, so the only change for such a host is the reported state.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Supported host release detection

The system SHALL detect the host operating system and release from `/etc/os-release` and report it against
the host releases the support matrix declares. A host that is not one of those releases SHALL be reported as
unsupported — naming the detected release and the supported ones — rather than assumed usable, and `check`
SHALL still complete without error.

#### Scenario: A supported Ubuntu release is reported OK

- **WHEN** `provision check` runs on one of the Ubuntu releases the matrix declares
- **THEN** the host row is OK and names the detected release

#### Scenario: An unsupported host is reported, not assumed

- **WHEN** `provision check` runs on a host whose OS or release is not in the matrix — including an
  apt-family host such as Debian
- **THEN** the host row reports it as unsupported, names the detected release and the supported ones, and the
  check still completes without error
